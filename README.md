# Concrete Crack Classification

Crack detection is important for structural health monitoring and inspection of buildings. In this project, 2 models were built: one a simple neural netowrk with one hidden layer

The dataset consists of 40, 000  RGB images, 20,000 with cracks or positive and 20,000 with no cracks or negative. The data was dowloaded from [Mendeley Data](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/5y9wdsg2zt/1).

* Simple model with an input and output layer
* Resnet18 model
